Mining Control To-Do List:
- DONE, TEST: Increase safeguards for trencher
Using failure data as a reference, set a limit on the maximum (power? current?) that can be commanded to the trencher motor, regardless of auto or manual operation mode.

- Set hopper indexing to stop at a certain point
Could do hopper encoder ticks, or perhaps stop once trencher has passed a certain angle? Or both (angle first, then ticks)

- DONE, TEST: Get trencher/sector control using a running average of reported current values rather than every single point

- Introduce some sort of timing cutoff for plunging - this could trigger the sector to lift slightly, then restart plunge

- IN PROGRESS: Clean/restructure code
